                    <h1>Why it was founded:</h1>
                    <p> The founder, Ranjani Ramanathan, was fond of Reality TV ever since she 
                        was a teenager. She knows that real life has more suspense and drama than 
                        even the most exciting fiction. However, she noticed that other people were 
                        reluctant to watch they cannot make sense from what they hear from other people. 
                        To encourage people to watch reality TV, she made a site, right here,where 
                        people can browse reality TV shows by their topic of interest!
